 <li>A processor uses 23 bits for its memory addressing. How many possible distinct locations (in decimal) can the computer address?</li>

 <li>How is the memory address (6234)<sub>10 </sub>represented in binary (base 2)?</li>

 <li>How is the memory address (6234)<sub>10 </sub>represented in hexadecimal (base 16)?</li>

 <li>What is the maximum 2’s complement integer that can be stored in a memory location that stores 17 bits of data? (Give your answer in decimal.)</li>

 <li>What is the minimum 2’s complement (or smallest negative) integer that can be stored in a memory location that stores 17 bits of data? (Give your answer in decimal.)</li>

 <li>Convert the numeral 0x3C32CB directly to binary.</li>

 <li>Convert 1420<sub>10</sub> into the 2’s complement 16-bit binary representation.</li>

 <li>Convert -252<sub>10</sub> into the 2’s complement 16-bit binary representation.</li>

 <li>Convert the octal value 1047<sub>8 </sub>into binary</li>

 <li>Convert the octal value 1047<sub>8 </sub>into Hexadecimal</li>

 <li>Given two binary numbers 0b10011011 and 0b01101001, perform a bit wise AND operation. Provide the result in binary.</li>

 <li>Given two binary numbers 0b10101011 and 0b01001101, perform a bit wise OR operation. Provide the result in binary.</li>

 <li>Given two binary numbers 0b10011010 and 0b01011001, perform a bit wise XOR operation. Provide the result in binary.</li>

 <li>Given the hexadecimal number 0x19BC, perform a bit wise NOT operation (complement). Provide the result in hexadecimal.</li>

 <li>When a <u>binary shift</u> operation is performed binary data can be shifted right or left and a ‘0’ is brought to fill vacated positions while the bit that is shifted out is discarded. Shift the 8-bit binary number that is equivalent to 0x17 right two, give the result in binary.</li>

 <li>When a <u>binary rotate</u> operation is performed binary data can be shifted right or left: the bit that is shifted out from one end will be brought back in on the other end.  Rotate the 8-bit binary number that is equivalent to 0x4B <u>left </u>two, give the result in binary.</li>

 <li>For an 8-bit (byte) sized binary number, what mask and operation would you use to set (make 1) the lower 2 bits without changing the remaining bits?
